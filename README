Allows injecting code into MB module before compilation.

Needs python 2.

Copy the compile.py file to the same folder your mod source files are. Also make scripts directory.

The scripts are located in "scripts" folder. Each is in a *.py file. 

Each script should contain "from pp import *" at the beginning.
After that you can modify the variables in each module as you wish.
They are the same as in module_*.py files (e.g. if you want to edit mission templates edit mission_templates variable).
Do check if mutation applies.

All header_*/ID_*/module_* variables will be imported automatically with pp.

When ready simply run compile.py and it will be compiled as normal with the applied changes.
